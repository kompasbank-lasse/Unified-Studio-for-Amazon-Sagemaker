**Automate deployment of data applications across SageMaker Unified Studio environments**

Deploy Airflow DAGs, Jupyter notebooks, and ML workflows from development to production with confidence. Built for data scientists, data engineers, ML engineers, and GenAI app developers working with DevOps teams.

**Works with your deployment strategy:** Whether you use git branches (branch-based), versioned artifacts (bundle-based), git tags (tag-based), or direct deployment - this CLI supports your workflow. Define your application once, deploy it your way.

---

## Why SMUS CI/CD CLI?

✅ **AWS Abstraction Layer** - CLI encapsulates all AWS analytics, ML, and SMUS complexity - DevOps teams never call AWS APIs directly  
✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Data teams define WHAT to deploy (manifest.yaml), DevOps teams define HOW and WHEN (CI/CD workflows)  
✅ **Generic CI/CD Workflows** - Same workflow works for Glue, SageMaker, Bedrock, QuickSight, or any AWS service combination  
✅ **Deploy with Confidence** - Automated testing and validation before production  
✅ **Multi-Environment Management** - Test → Prod with environment-specific configuration  
✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - Version-controlled application manifests and reproducible deployments  
✅ **Event-Driven Workflows** - Trigger workflows automatically via EventBridge on deployment  

---

## Quick Start

**Install from source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws/Unified-Studio-for-Amazon-Sagemaker.git
cd Unified-Studio-for-Amazon-Sagemaker/experimental/SMUS-CICD-pipeline-cli
pip install -e .
```

**Deploy your first application:**
```bash
# Validate configuration
smus-cli describe --manifest manifest.yaml --connect

# Create deployment bundle (optional)
smus-cli bundle --manifest manifest.yaml

# Deploy to test environment
smus-cli deploy --targets test --manifest manifest.yaml

# Run validation tests
smus-cli test --manifest manifest.yaml --targets test
```

## Who Is This For?

### 👨‍💻 Data Teams (Data Scientists, Data Engineers, GenAI App Developers)
**You focus on:** Your application - what to deploy, where to deploy, and how it runs  
**You define:** Application manifest (`manifest.yaml`) with your code, workflows, and configurations  
**You don't need to know:** CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, deployment automation  

→ **[Quick Start Guide](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md)** - Deploy your first application in 10 minutes  

**Includes examples for:**
- Data Engineering (Glue, Notebooks, Athena)
- ML Workflows (SageMaker, Notebooks)
- GenAI Applications (Bedrock, Notebooks)

### 🔧 DevOps Teams
**You focus on:** CI/CD best practices, security, compliance, and deployment automation  
**You define:** Workflow templates that enforce testing, approvals, and promotion policies  
**You don't need to know:** Application-specific details, AWS services used, DataZone APIs, SMUS project structures, or business logic  

→ **[Admin Guide](docs/getting-started/admin-quickstart.md)** - Configure infrastructure and pipelines in 15 minutes  
→ **[GitHub Workflow Templates](git-templates/)** - Generic, reusable workflow templates for automated deployment

**The CLI is your abstraction layer:** You just call `smus-cli deploy` - the CLI handles all AWS service interactions (DataZone, Glue, Athena, SageMaker, MWAA, S3, IAM, etc.). Your workflows stay simple and generic.

## Core Concepts

### Separation of Concerns: The Key Design Principle

**The Problem:** Traditional deployment approaches force DevOps teams to learn AWS analytics services (Glue, Athena, DataZone, SageMaker, MWAA, etc.) and understand SMUS project structures, or force data teams to become CI/CD experts.

**The Solution:** SMUS CLI is the abstraction layer that encapsulates all AWS and SMUS complexity.

**Example workflow:**

```
1. DevOps Team                 2. Data Team                    3. SMUS CLI (The Abstraction)
   ↓                               ↓                              ↓
Defines the PROCESS            Defines the CONTENT            Workflow calls:
- Test on merge                - Glue jobs                    smus-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml
- Approval for prod            - SageMaker training             ↓
- Security scans               - Athena queries               CLI handles ALL AWS complexity:
- Notification rules           - File structure               - DataZone APIs
                                                              - Glue/Athena/SageMaker APIs
Defines INFRASTRUCTURE                                        - MWAA deployment
- Account & region                                            - S3 management
- IAM roles                                                   - IAM configuration
- Resources                                                   - Infrastructure provisioning

Works for ANY app!
No ML/Analytics/GenAI
service knowledge needed!
```

**DevOps teams focus on:**
- CI/CD best practices (testing, approvals, notifications)
- Security and compliance gates
- Deployment orchestration
- Monitoring and alerting

**SMUS CLI handles ALL AWS complexity:**
- DataZone domain and project management
- AWS Glue, Athena, SageMaker, MWAA APIs
- S3 storage and artifact management
- IAM roles and permissions
- Connection configurations
- Catalog asset subscriptions
- Workflow deployment to Airflow
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Testing and validation

**Data teams focus on:**
- Application code and workflows
- Which AWS services to use (Glue, Athena, SageMaker, etc.)
- Environment configurations
- Business logic

**Result:** 
- **DevOps teams never call AWS APIs directly** - they just call `smus-cli deploy`
- **CI/CD workflows are generic** - same workflow works for Glue apps, SageMaker apps, or Bedrock apps
- Data teams never touch CI/CD configs
- Both teams work independently using their expertise

---

### Application Manifest
A declarative YAML file (`manifest.yaml`) that defines your data application:
- **Application details** - Name, version, description
- **Content** - Code from git repositories, data/models from storage, QuickSight dashboards
- **Workflows** - Airflow DAGs for orchestration and automation
- **Stages** - Where to deploy (dev, test, prod environments)
- **Configuration** - Environment-specific settings, connections, and bootstrap actions

**Created and owned by data teams.** Defines **what** to deploy and **where**. No CI/CD knowledge required.

### Application
Your data/analytics workload being deployed:
- Airflow DAGs and Python scripts
- Jupyter notebooks and data files
- ML models and training code
- ETL pipelines and transformations
- GenAI agents and MCP servers
- Foundation model configurations

### Stage
A deployment environment (dev, test, prod) mapped to a SageMaker Unified Studio project:
- Domain and region configuration
- Project name and settings
- Resource connections (S3, Airflow, Athena, Glue)
- Environment-specific parameters
- Optional branch mapping for git-based deployments

### Stage-to-Project Mapping

Each application stage deploys to a dedicated SageMaker Unified Studio (SMUS) project. A project can host a single application or multiple applications depending on your architecture and CI/CD methodology. Stage projects are independent entities with their own governance:

- **Ownership & Access:** Each stage project has its own set of owners and contributors, which may differ from the development project. Production projects typically have restricted access compared to development environments.
- **Multi-Domain & Multi-Region:** Stage projects can belong to different SMUS domains, AWS accounts, and regions. For example, your dev stage might deploy to a development domain in us-east-1, while prod deploys to a production domain in eu-west-1.
- **Flexible Architecture:** Organizations can choose between dedicated projects per application (isolation) or shared projects hosting multiple applications (consolidation), based on security, compliance, and operational requirements.

This separation enables true environment isolation with independent access controls, compliance boundaries, and regional data residency requirements.

### Workflow
Orchestration logic that executes your application. Workflows serve two purposes:

**1. Deployment-time:** Create required AWS resources during deployment
- Provision infrastructure (S3 buckets, databases, IAM roles)
- Configure connections and permissions
- Set up monitoring and logging

**2. Runtime:** Execute ongoing data and ML pipelines
- Scheduled execution (daily, hourly, etc.)
- Event-driven triggers (S3 uploads, API calls)
- Data processing and transformations
- Model training and inference

Workflows are defined as Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in YAML format. Supports [MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow)](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/) and [Amazon MWAA Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-amazon-mwaa-serverless/) ([User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/mwaa-serverless-userguide/what-is-mwaa-serverless.html)).

### CI/CD Automation
GitHub Actions workflows (or other CI/CD systems) that automate deployment:
- **Created and owned by DevOps teams**
- Defines **how** and **when** to deploy
- Runs tests and quality gates
- Manages promotion across targets
- Enforces security and compliance policies
- Example: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Key insight:** DevOps teams create generic, reusable workflows that work for ANY application. They don't need to know if the app uses Glue, SageMaker, or Bedrock - the CLI handles all AWS service interactions. The workflow just calls `smus-cli deploy` and the CLI does the rest.

### Deployment Modes

**Bundle-based (Artifact):** Create versioned archive → deploy archive to stages
- Good for: audit trails, rollback capability, compliance
- Command: `smus-cli bundle` then `smus-cli deploy --manifest app.tar.gz`

**Direct (Git-based):** Deploy directly from sources without intermediate artifacts
- Good for: simpler workflows, rapid iteration, git as source of truth
- Command: `smus-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stage test`

Both modes work with any combination of storage and git content sources.

## Example Applications

Real-world examples showing how to deploy different workloads with SMUS CI/CD.

### 📊 Analytics - QuickSight Dashboard
Deploy interactive BI dashboards with automated Glue ETL pipelines for data preparation. Uses QuickSight asset bundles, Athena queries, and GitHub dataset integration with environment-specific configurations.

**AWS Services:** QuickSight • Glue • Athena • S3 • MWAA Serverless

**GitHub Workflow:** [analytic-dashboard-glue-quicksight.yml](https://github.com/aws/Unified-Studio-for-Amazon-Sagemaker/actions/workflows/analytic-dashboard-glue-quicksight.yml)

**What happens during deployment:** Application code is deployed to S3, Glue jobs and Airflow workflows are created and executed, QuickSight dashboard/data source/dataset are created, and QuickSight ingestion is initiated to refresh the dashboard with latest data.
